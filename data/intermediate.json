        "text": "The workplace has changed significantly over the past decades. Modern jobs often require digital skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. Many people now work remotely, using technology to stay connected with colleagues. This flexibility offers advantages but also creates challenges, such as maintaining motivation at home. Career development is no longer about staying in one company for life. Instead, workers often change jobs or retrain to adapt to new industries. Soft skills, like communication and leadership, are as important as technical knowledge. In the future, success in the world of work will depend on adaptability, creativity, and lifelong learning."
